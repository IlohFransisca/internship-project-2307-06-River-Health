# RivHealth

## Overview

My team and I observed a lack of understanding among stakeholders about river health and its impact, including issues like sewage discharges, agricultural runoff, misconnected sewers, illegal dumping, and industrial waste. To address this, we are developing a platform, RivHealth, to provide a comprehensive view of river health and identify pollution sources. Our goal is to empower stakeholders such as water companies, river conservation trusts, environmental agencies, farmers, and local authorities with data-backed insights for informed decision-making and policy development.

## About RivHealth

RivHealth delivers a data-driven, user-friendly platform for assessing river health, presenting comprehensive metrics via an interactive geospatial interface. By integrating diverse data sources and advanced analytics, RivHealth enables proactive interventions by identifying pollution-prone areas and enhancing environmental management strategies. We know how important the health of our rivers is to our planet, but sadly our rivers are facing a lot of problems. Pollution from farms, changes we make to the land around rivers, and climate change are all hurting them.

## Case Study: River Thame Operational Catchment Area

We worked on the River Thame operational catchment area (a tributary of the Thames River in the UK) to determine pollutants above the threshold on each sampling point. The blue map shows the operational catchment and the different monitor colors show the different sampling points. The color of each monitor depends on the health status of the river. 

### Health Status Indicators

- **Green**: Good health
- **Orange**: Poor
- **Red**: Critical 

### Discharge Indicators

- **Pink**: Discharge
- **Blue**: No discharge 

### Interactive Features

When a user clicks on a particular point, it shows:
- The status of the river at that point.
- A time series graph of the pollutants present at that point, indicating whether they are below, within, or above the threshold.

## Goals

- Empower stakeholders with data-backed insights.
- Facilitate informed decision-making and policy development.
- Enhance environmental management strategies by identifying pollution-prone areas.

## Stakeholders

- Water Companies
- River Conservation Trusts
- Environmental Agencies
- Farmers
- Local Authorities

We are committed to leveraging data and technology to ensure the health of our rivers for future generations.
